Fruit Ninja:

Fruit Ninja was a mobile game from Halfbrick Studios.
It was a huge hit, gaining massive popularity.
The game is extremely simple, and the original version was created in just a few weeks.
It was one of the first mobile games to make use of the touchscreen dragging/slicing mechanic.

The goal of the game is to slice fruit that pop up in the air, and avoid bombs.
The game ends when the player slices a bomb, or misses 3 fruit.

The player can get combos for slicing multiple fruits.
Other games using this mechanic have a "multi-slice" feature, which allows for you to slice the same fruit multiple times.

Target Resolutions:

960 x 540

Godot's default of 1152 by 648 is also 16 by 9 aspect ratio
Landscape Mode


==============================================

Completed Goals:

# Create a trail the follow the mouse around when clicking and dragging.
# This will be use for the slice effect.
# White trail follows cursor dragging/slicing

# Play slice sound if trail length and speed are high enough
# Enter at one point, exit at another point, and dragging=true the entire time

# Create a main menu
# Start button (game)
# Settings menu
# About/Credits menu

# Add background music
# Add button to mute SFX and button to mute Music
# Add slider for SFX volume and Music volume

# Score on top left (number of fruit sliced.) Show best under it
# num_bots doesn't work when slicing


# GAMEPLAY
# Create a new game mode where the godot bots are tossed up from the bottom of the screen
# (Save the old game mode as Endless or Arcade mode so you can still play it.)
# (Scores for endless and classic mode should be saved and displayed separately.)

# In Classic mode--
# Number of tries (3) on top right
# Fruit tossed from bottom of screen
# Fruit that is not sliced and touches killzone makes you lose a try

# losing a life triggers a sound fx and a popup or vfx of some kind
# 3 tries triggers gameover

# GAMEOVER
# score/high score displayed at game over
# "try again?" or quit to main buttons


# Add critical and multi-fruit combos (3+ within single swipe)
# The chances of performing a critical are random (or higher if mouse speed is high enough?)
# Add a "bomb" sprite which makes you lose instantly if you slice it.
# number squared
# 1 - 1
# 2 - 2^2 = 4
# 3 - 3^2 = 9
# 4 - 4^2 = 16
# 5^2 = 25
# 6^2 = 36

==============================================
